# üêç Practice Project: Exploring OOP Concepts in Python

This project is a hands-on exercise for learning and implementing core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The code establishes a basic structure for managing users and products in a hypothetical system.

---

## üéØ Core Concepts Implemented

This project covers the following key concepts:

* **Class & Object:**
    The foundation of the program is built by defining classes like `User`, `Customer`, `Reseller`, and `Product`, from which different objects can be created.

* **Inheritance:**
    The `Customer` and `Reseller` classes inherit from the `User` class, gaining all of its attributes and methods. This prevents code duplication.
    ```python
    class Customer(User):
        pass
    ```

* **Method Overriding:**
    The `Reseller` class overrides the `check_password` method from its parent class, changing its behavior.

* **Constructor (`__init__`) & `super()`:**
    Each class has an `__init__` method to initialize an object's attributes. The `super()` function is used to call the parent class's constructor from within a child class.

* **Class Variables:**
    Class variables are used to share data among all instances of a class, such as `product_list` in the `Product` class, which keeps a list of all created products.

* **`@classmethod`:**
    In the `User` class, the `@classmethod` decorator is used to create the `create` method. This method has access to the class itself (not a specific instance) and can perform operations like validation before creating an object.

* **`@staticmethod`:**
    The `validate_password` method in the `User` class is defined as a static method. It's a utility function that doesn't depend on the class or its instances but is placed inside the class for logical grouping.

* **`@property`:**
    In the `Customer` class, the `@property` decorator is used for the `wallet` method. This allows us to access the method as if it were a regular attribute (without parentheses), improving code readability.
    ```python
    # Instead of customer1.wallet(), we write:
    print(customer1.wallet)
    ```

* **Special Methods:**
    The `__str__` method is used to define a user-friendly string representation of objects, so they provide meaningful output when printed.

## üöÄ How to Use

This code is designed as a module. You can import the classes and instantiate them:

```python
# Create a new user with the classmethod
user1 = User.create('zoya', 'pass123', 'Zoya Hussain', 'zoya@example.com')

# Create a product
product1 = Product(upc="12345", name="Laptop", price=1200)

# Display information
print(user1)
print(product1)

# Access the property
# customer1 = Customer(...)
# print(customer1.wallet

# Python Employee Class

A simple Python script that defines an `Employee` class to demonstrate key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Features

-   **Private Attributes:** Uses `__name` and `__salary` for encapsulation.
-   **Class Attribute:** Tracks the total number of employees with `_total_employees`.
-   **`@classmethod`:** A class method `get_total_employees()` to return the total employee count.
-   **`@staticmethod`:** A static method `is_valid_salary()` to perform a utility check.
-   **`__str__` Method:** Provides a clean, readable string representation of employee objects.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Save the code as `employee.py`.
3.  Run the script from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python employee.py
    ```

## Expected Output
Employee Info: Name: Alice, Salary: 7500 Name: Bob, Salary: 4800
Total Employees: 2

**Subject:**
feat: Implement Employee class with core OOP concepts


**Body:**
This commit introduces the Employee class, which demonstrates several key object-oriented programming principles.

Defines the class with private attributes for name and salary.

Adds a class method to track the total number of employees.

Adds a static method for salary validation logic.

Implements the str method for a user-friendly object representation.

Includes a README.md file with setup and usage instructions.
